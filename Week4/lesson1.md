# Week 4 Lesson 1 #
## Supervised Learning: Decision Trees ##

In this lesson, you will gain an introduction to Supervised Learning,
specifically via the decision tree algorithm also known as CART, which
is short for Classification And Regression Tree. The decision tree
algorithm is a basic machine learning algorithm that is frequently used
to visualize (and thus understand) how the machine is making a
classification or regression decision. While this algorithm is important
on its own, it is also important since it forms the basis for many
ensemble learning techniques, such as the popular random forest
algorithm.

###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts behind the decision tree algorithm
- Be able to create and use a decision tree by using the scikit learn library
- Understand how this algorithm can be successfully applied to specific problem categories.
