#Week 15 Overview#

## Introduction to Deep Learning ##

This week we introduce deep learning. Deep learning has become an
incredibly popular form of machine learning that generally leveraged
some type of neural network to learn from data in order to make
predictions. While neural networks have been around for some time, deep
learning is fairly new, and has found applications in many areas,
especially image processing and natural language processing. In the one
lesson for this week, we will introduce neural networks and deep
learning, as well as provide additional resources for future study.

### Objectives ###

#####By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:######

- Understand the basic concepts of a neural network
