# Week 15 Lesson 1 #

## Introduction to Deep Learning ##

In this lesson, you will about neural networks and their application in
deep learning. First, we review the basic concepts behind neural
networks and how they can easily be constructed in Python. Next, we
introduce deep learning by building on the basic concepts of neural
networks and demonstrate how they can be applied in different contexts,
such as image processing and analysis and natural language processing.
Finally, in the course notebook, you will see how to use the Keras
library to apply deep learning by using Python.

###Objectives ###
