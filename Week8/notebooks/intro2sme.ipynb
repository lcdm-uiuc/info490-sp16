    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this IPython Notebook, we explore email messages as a data source for\n",
    "text analysis. Email is among the oldest forms of social media and have\n",
    "a fairly long history of an application area for text analysis. While an\n",
    "email message might seem fairly simple, an email can actually be quite\n",
    "complicated. Part of this complication arises from the requirements to\n",
    "safely and securely transmit an electronic message through the Internet.\n",
    "This information, which is metadata about the message itself, is\n",
    "generally included in the email header. \n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of the complication, however, arises from the change of\n",
    "emails moving beyond simple textual content to include multiple\n",
    "components within an email message. To handle multiple components, which\n",
    "can include images, documents, or just HTML-styled versions of the text\n",
    "content, email messages must enable multiple parts of a message to be\n",
    "identified and properly encoded/decoded (for example, binary or Unicode\n",
    "data) for safe and secure transmission. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this Notebook, we first explore reading and parsing a\n",
    "simple email, including both the header, message itself, and the\n",
    "different parts (or payloads) within the message. Next, we develop a\n",
    "text classification pipeline from a public email corpus. Finally, we\n",
    "apply this pipeline to blind emails to quantify the accuracy of our\n",

    "Python provides built-in support for [processing email messages][pem],\n",
    "which are an often overlooked source of information in data science\n",
    "projects. The library is part of the core Python distribution, and\n",
    "includes support for parsing email messages, as well as sending and\n",
    "receiving emails. For our purpose, we simply need to read in text and\n",
    "create an email `message`, which provides access to the basic email\n",
    "contents. The `message` instance provides access to the email header\n",
    "information as well as any payload data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Normally the payload is the email message, but with multipart messages,\n",
    "like HTML email messages, an email can have multiple payloads. In the\n",
    "next several code cells, we create an email `message` by reading an\n",
    "email from a file (the email should look familiar). We subsequently\n",
    "explore the Python email message interface to extract email headers and\n",
    "the message payload, before grabbing the HTML message for later parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we read in one demonstration email (that I sent out to a class)\n",
    "and display message headers, which are accessible via dictionary keys.\n",
    "In the second code cell, we explicitly retrieve message header values by\n",
    "using the `msg` dictionary. Note that headers can be repeated (for\n",
    "example, the `Received` header as different mail servers add additional\n",
    "header information as the message is transmitted. Finally, in the third\n",
