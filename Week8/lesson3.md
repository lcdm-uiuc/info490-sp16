# Week 8 Lesson 3 #
## Introduction to Social Media: Web ##

In this lesson, you will be introduced to web-accessible data. While web
data might be less popular than other forms of social media, the number
and diversity of web accessible data sets make this form of social data
among the most rich for text analysis. First we will analyze a web page
to extract data. Second, we will analyze a website as a networked
resource to construct a summary document of data spread across multiple
pages. As a demonstration of these concepts, we use the University of
Illinois Course explorer website. This project requires programmatically
accessing web data, parsing web pages, and extracting information from
structured documents.

###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand how to access web-accessible data
