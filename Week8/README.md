#Week 8 Overview#

## Introduction to Social Media ##

This week we will introduce social media, which is a form of data that
is constructed by users and either distributed to others or publicly
released. Popular examples of this type of data include emails, tweets,
and web pages. These types of data can be accessed either via build-in
Python libraries, public APIs, or simple web scraping. Specifically,
this week you will learn how to parse and classify emails, how to
authenticate to twitter to enable searching the twitter data stream, and
how to obtain, parse, and process web-accessible data.
