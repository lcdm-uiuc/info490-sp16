# Week 14 Lesson 3 #
## Working with Data ##

In this lesson, you will review a worked example that demonstrates how
to work with different data sets to make an interesting data
visualization known as a chloropleth. To do this we need to access web
resources, parse an XML-based data format, extract meaningful data from
a second web accessible resource, and combine it all into a new and
interesting visualization.

###Objectives ###

- Understand how to download and access web resources.
