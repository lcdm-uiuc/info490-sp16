    "### Using Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark is a framework for processing large-data tasks, in general this\n",
    "means Petabytes (or more of data). Spark can run on the HDFS file\n",
    "system, which can be set up to chunk files into blocks and to replicate\n",
    "these blocks across a cluster's storage to promote increased\n",
    "performance. Spark abstracts these details, however, allowing us to\n",
    "develop an application on a small system and scale up to large data on a\n",
    "cluster. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Spark, communications move between a driver process and the execution\n",
    "processes. This communication is handled for us by using a\n",
    "[`SparkContext`][sc], which requests resources from the Spark master\n",
    "process, such as number of cores, which are reserved to complete our\n",
    "Spark tasks. In the previous code cell, we initialized our\n",
    "`SparkContext`. Once a Spark Context is active, we can use the Spark\n",
    "Console to monitor jobs and the overall Spark infrastructure. The\n",
    "Jupyter Server currently sets an HTTP header (`X-Frame-Options`) that\n",
    "prevents us from easily displaying this console within this Notebook.\n",
    "However, if you open a new web browser to the IP address of this\n",
    "Notebook and use `4040` as the port number, you should be able to view\n",
    "and interact with the console, as shown in the following screenshot:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Spark Console](images/spark-console.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic data structure in Spark is a [Resilient Distributed\n",
    "Dataset][rdd] (RDD). An RDD is immutable, thus if you want to add a\n",
    "column to an RDD, you must create a new copy that includes the new\n",
    "column. In Spark, data processing tasks can be transformation or\n",
    "actions, and these tasks can be pipelined for efficiency. Each\n",
    "transformation creates a new RDD, but since Spark uses lazy evaluation,\n",
    "the transformations are not executed until an action is invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts are demonstrated in the following code cells, where we\n",
