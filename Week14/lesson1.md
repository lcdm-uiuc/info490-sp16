# Week 14 Lesson 1 #
## Pandas and Databases ##

In this lesson, you will learn how to work with a SQL based database by
using the Pandas Python library. Pandas simplifies many data tasks by
hiding details that are not relevant for many projects. In this case,
Pandas can hide many of the database interaction mechanisms to allow one
to easily query, update, or insert new data into an existing database.

- Understand the basic concepts involved in using a Pandas DataFrame to interact with a database.
- Understand how to query data by using Pandas.
- Understand how to update data by using Pandas.
- Understand how to use Pandas to create and populate new database tables.
