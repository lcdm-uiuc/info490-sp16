#Week 5 Overview#

## Introduction to Unsupervised Learning ##

This week you will learn about unsupervised learning, where knowledge is
extracted from data with no or little a prior assumptions. The most
important unsupervised learning techniques that we will explore this
week include dimensional reduction, cluster finding, and density
estimation. We will use the scikit learn library to apply each of these
techniques to real data, to reduce the dimensionality of a data set
prior to apply an additional algorithm, to identify groups or clusters
within a data set, and to functionally approximate a binned or
discrete data set, respectively.

### Objectives ###

#####By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:######

- Understand the basic concepts of dimension reduction and be able to apply PCA
- Understand the basic principles of cluster detection and be able to apply k-means and DBSCAN
- Understand density estimation and be able to apply KDE
