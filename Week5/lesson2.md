# Week 5 Lesson 2 #
## Unsupervised Learning: Introduction to Clustering ##

In this lesson, you will learn about the Unsupervised Learning technique of clustering.

###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts behind clustering
- Understand the basic concepts behind the k-means and DBSCAN algorithms
- Be able to apply k-means and DBSCAN by using the scikit learn library

### Time Estimate ###

Approximately 2 hours.

### Readings ####
