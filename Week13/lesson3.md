# Week 13 Lesson 3 #
## Introduction to Graph Databases ##

In this lesson, you will learn about graph databases, which provide a
mechanism for not only persisting graph data structures but also a
powerful search mechanisms to quickly find sub-graphs. One of the most
popular graph database is Neo4J, which we will use to create and persist
graph data structures. This will involve the Python Neo4J database
driver, that allows us to directly operate on graphs in the Neo4J
database via functions calls or to use the Cypher query language to
create, update, delete, or find subgraphs.

###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts of a graph database
- Be familiar with the Neo4J database and the Cypher query language
- Be able to use the py2neo Neo4J database driver to communicate with a
Neo4J database from a Python program.
