# Week 2 Overview#

## General Linear Models ##

In this week, you will build on previous material to develop more
powerful techniques for computing general linear models by using Python.
First, you will learn how to develop models that include multiple
variables by performing multiple regression. You also will learn abut
the different metrics that quantify how well a regression model
represents a data set. Second, you will learn about regularization and
how it can reduce the likelihood that your model might result in
overfitting and how it can be used to select the best attributes for
quantifying a model. Finally, you will learn how to extend these
regression concepts to categorical variables, such as a variable that
encodes a _Yes/No_ result.

### Objectives ###

##### By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:######

- Understand how to perform regression on multiple variables by using Python.
- Understand the concept of regularization and be able to apply it to regression problems by using Python.
- Understand logistic regression and how to compute it by using Python.
