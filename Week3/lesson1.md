# Week 3 Lesson 1 #
## Supervised Learning: Nearest Neighbor ##

In this lesson, you will gain an introduction to Supervised Learning,
specifically via the nearest neighbor algorithm and a discussion of
classification and regression metrics such as precision, recall, and f1
score. The nearest neighbor algorithm, more generally known as k-nearest
neighbor is one of the simplest machine learning algorithms to learn,
and often provides a quick and easy benchmark comparison for more
advanced techniques. 

###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts behind the k-nearest neighbor algorithm
- Be able to apply k-nn by using the scikit learn library
- Understand the class of problems where this algorithm can be successfully applied.

### Time Estimate ###
