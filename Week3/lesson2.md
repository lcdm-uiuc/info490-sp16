# Week 3 Lesson 2 #
## Supervised Learning: Support Vector Machine ##

In this lesson, you will learn about the supervised learning technique
known as Support Vector Machine, or SVM. SVM has historically been a
very popular machine learning algorithm since it is both fairly
intuitive and rather powerful. SVM can be applied to both classification
problems, where is may be called SVC, and to regression problems.  

###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts behind the SVM algorithm
- Be able to apply SVM by using the scikit learn library
- Understand how to use SVM for classification problems
- Understand how to use SVM for regression problems

### Time Estimate ###

Approximately 2 hours.

### Readings ####

_Course Notebook_
