#Week 3 Overview#

## Introduction to Supervised Learning ##

In this week, you will learn about several basic supervised learning
algorithms, including the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, support vector
machine, and naive Bayes. Each of these algorithms have Python
implementations in the scikit learn library and are easy to apply to a
wide range of classification or regression problems. In addition, you
will learn about classification and regression metrics, such as the
precision, recall, and f1 score, and how to use them effectively to
compare the results of different machine learning algorithms.

### Objectives ###

##### By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:######

- Know the basic classification and regression metrics.
- Understand the k-nearest neighbor algorithm
- Understand the support vector machine algorithm
- Understand the naive Bayes algorithm
