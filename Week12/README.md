#Week 12 Overview#

## Cloud Computing ##

This week we introduce Hadoop, perhaps the dominant method of big data
processing in use today. Originally, Hadoop was develop to enable
MapReduce tasks to be quickly executed. While this paradigm is still in
place, new paradigms, such as Spark, are also now available, which means
Hadoop will continue to exist as an important part of the Big Data
landscape for much longer. This week, you will learn about Hadoop, and
specifically the Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS), the MapReduce
programming paradigm, and the Pig platform, which simplifies the task of
writing MapReduce tasks.

### Objectives ###

#####By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:######

- Understand the basic concepts of Cloud Computing.
- Understand the basics of the Hadoop platform
- Understand how to use HDFS
- Understand the MapReduce approach to computing, and how to use Pig to create MapReduce applications.
- Be able to execute MapReduce tasks in a Hadoop environment.
