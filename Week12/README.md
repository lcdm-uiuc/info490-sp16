## Introduction to Data Persistence ##

This week you will learn about relational database management systems
(RDBMS), still the most popular data storage technology. You will learn
SQL, the language by which database users interact with a relational
database. To test database and SQL concepts, we will use the open source
database system known as SQLite, specifically version 3 of the SQLite
database known as sqlite3. Note, most of the documentation you will read
and follow online will refer to running the sqlite program at the
command line, you will run the sqlite3 program both from within an
IPython Notebook and at the command line. Using SQLite, you will learn
about SQL data definition language (DDL) functionality and SQL data
manipulation language (DML) functionality.
