# Week 12 Lesson 3 #
## Introduction to Pig ##

In this lesson, you will learn about Hadoop Pig. One problem with the
Hadoop MapReduce paradigm is the challenge of creating map and reduce
programs. To simplify this task, a new language, called Pig Latin, was
created to simplify the creation of Map Reduce tasks. Pig is an ETL
(extract, transform, load) language, that is similar in many respect to
SQL (or Pandas). As a result, it can be simple to load multiple data
sets, process them, group them, and join the results, before saving them
to a new file.
