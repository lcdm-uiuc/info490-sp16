    "the data set by the number of occurrences (in descending order) and limit\n",
    "the output in some manner. Finally, we should save our result and\n",
    "display only the top occurring tokens. To complete these steps, we will\n",
    "employ the following Pig operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Load`: to load a file into a Pig data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `FOREACH`: to iterate through each item in a data set. We first step\n",
    "through each line in the file, before we step through each item in a\n",
    "group of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `TOKENIZE`: to generate tokens from each line in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `GENERATE FLATTEN`: to generate a list of words from the tokens in the\n",
    "line.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `GROUP ... By`: to group all identical tokens together\n",
    "\n",
    "- `COUNT`: to compute the number of times each token occurs in the\n",
    "grouped token data set\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ORDER BY DESC`: to order the data set in descending order by a\n",
    "column. In this case, we use `$1` to refer to the second column in the\n",
    "grouping, which is the counts for each token.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `LIMIT`: to limit the number of items in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `STORE ... INTO`: to save the results into a named file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `DUMP`: to display the data to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "once we have created this Pig script, we run Pig in local mode (via the\n",
    "`-x local` flag) and send the STDERR to `/dev/null`, which hides all\n",
