# Week 10 Lesson 3 #
## Introduction to Network Analysis: Social Media ##

In this lesson, you will learn about network analysis applied to social
media. Specifically, we will take techniques presented in the first two
lessons from this week, and apply them to social media data sources that
were discussed in [Week 8](../Week8/Readme.md). You will learn about
social networking concepts like circles, cliques, and clusters, and
about the concept of centrality, which quantifies the importance of a
node in a network. Finally, you will learn to build an actual social
network graph in Python by using the NetworkX library. 

 
###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand basic social networking concepts such as cliques, social circles, clusters, and centrality.
- Be familiar with the utility of graph analysis to social media
- Be able to construct a social graph by applying NetworkX to social media data.
