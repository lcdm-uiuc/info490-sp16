# Week 10 Lesson 1 #

## Introduction to Network Analysis: Graph Concepts ##

In this lesson, you will learn basic graph concepts in network analysis.
Specifically, we will start by introducing the concept of a node, and how
nodes can be connected in a graph by edges. Next, we will contrast
undirected and directed graphs, before discussing how graphs, nodes, and
edges can all posses attributes. We will also explore the underlying
graph matrix representations including the adjacency and incidence
matrices. Finally, we will learn how to perform basic graph
visualizations in Python.

###Objectives ###

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic graph concepts including nodes and edges.
- Be familiar with the differences between undirected and directed graphs.
- Understand the relationship between a graph and its adjacency and incidence matrices.
- Be able to create and visualize a graph in Python by using the NetworkX library.
